ShortDescription: Bring order and security to your storage in three steps!
Description: |-
  SpaceObServer is an enterprise-grade storage management and analysis tool for Windows that continuously monitors disk usage across servers (local/network/cloud), archives file-level data in a SQL database, and automates reporting/compliance to optimize storage efficiency

  Key Features:
  - Continuous Scanning: Tracks storage changes in real-time via a background Scan Service, storing metadata in a SQL database for instant historical analysis and trend visualization.
  - Multi-Platform Support: Scans Windows/Linux servers, Exchange mailboxes, SharePoint, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and network drives.
  - Compliance & Security: Enforces RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), audits permissions, and ensures GDPR compliance with on-premises data processing.
  - Automation: Schedules scans, identifies redundant/old files, and triggers cleanup (e.g., deduplication via NTFS hardlinks).
  - Advanced Reporting: Generates exportable reports (PDF, Excel, HTML) and dashboards showing storage growth, file aging, and access patterns.
  - Web & Remote Access: Offers browser-based access (Web Access) and remote clients for administrators
