ShortDescription: Program that allows you to create an image from a set of words.
Description: Wordaizer creates word clouds like Wordle does. But with a twist. It allows you to have full freedom to tune your word cloud to any size, colour, font and shape. The application is capable of making really huge word clouds, up to twice the size of A0. Save your result, print the word cloud or show it on your screen. Even animate your cloud if you like. It is any good?
